# SparkCognition Renewables Take Home Challenge Application

Welcome to SparkCognition QA Coding Challenge!!

SparkCognition Renewable Suite is a predictive analytics and asset management platform for renewable energy. You can learn more about it at https://www.sparkcognition.com/sustainability/. Our platform gets large volumes of live data from turbines from multiple windfarms which needs to be displayed in user friendly format for analysis by field technicians. Attached here is a mini dashboard created using a few React framework with material ui (for buttons), highcharts (for all charts) and ag-grid (for the data table). See package.json for a full list of dependencies.

For coding challenge, your goal is to create QA test scenarios for this application and share those with us. Please use the BDD approach to document a list of test cases you will prepare for the application.

# Steps to Run:
npm install
npm start

# Goal/Deliverables
1. Clearly documented list of test cases using BDD approach and preferably in Gherkin Syntax
2. Use Cypress to automate the QA scenarios and share the well documented steps to run the scenarios. 
   
3. Bonus: If you can showcase use of additional tools such as JMeter etc. and anything that can help with performance testing of API of such an application then please include that. 

Clear documentation of test cases and steps to run/test your deliverables will be important
